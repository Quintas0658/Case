# Product-Channel Fit Cases

A curated collection of case studies showing how startups found their true growth channels.

## 🎯 What is Product-Channel Fit?

Most startups fail not because of bad products, but because they never find the right channels to reach their users. Product-Market Fit gets all the attention, but **Product-Channel Fit** is often the missing piece.

This collection studies real companies that cracked the channel code — from Reddit communities to industry forums, from influencer partnerships to unexpected platforms.
